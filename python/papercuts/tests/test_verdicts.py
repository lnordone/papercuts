"""Normalization of the prover's proof-status return value.

The pass/fail of a run comes from the tool's exit code, but the recorded
*verdict* is what tells you afterwards WHY a cut was rejected -- a real
refutation, a proof that ran out of budget, or a broken environment. Getting
that wrong is quietly expensive: it sends you debugging the setup when the
checker was working fine and simply said no.

The trap is that a proof returns "proven" only when every property shares that
status. A run that completed with a mix -- i.e. at least one refutation -- comes
back as "determined". Matching only "cex" therefore filed every ordinary refuted
cut under "error".
