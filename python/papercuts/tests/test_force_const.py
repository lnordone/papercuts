"""Coverage for the force-const cut family.

Forces reads of a 1-bit scalar (logic/reg/bit/wire) to a constant 1'b0/1'b1,
leaving the declaration and its driver intact. Only internal 1-bit scalars are
targeted -- multi-bit signals and ports are not collected -- and write positions
(assignment LHS, including inside an LHS concatenation) are never substituted.
